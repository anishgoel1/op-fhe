## Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

The Fully Homomorphic Encryption implementation in this project was inspired by the groundbreaking work of Craig Gentry, who introduced the first viable scheme for FHE.

## Multiparty Computation (MPC)

This project also utilizes ideas from secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), a field introduced by Andrew Yao in the early 1980s:

## Blockchain Gas Cost Analysis

The simulation performs blockchain-related operations such as gas cost analysis, which was inspired by Ethereumâ€™s original design, as detailed in the Ethereum Yellow Paper:

## Summary

The implementation in this project is built upon the foundational research of the aforementioned works. By leveraging advancements in FHE and MPC, this project simulates encrypted state transitions on blockchain data, ensuring privacy and security for the computations.
